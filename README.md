Docutron is a tool designed to facilitate the extraction of relevant information from legal documents, enabling professionals to create datasets for fine-tuning language models (LLM) for specific legal domains.

Legal professionals often deal with vast amounts of text data in various formats, including legal documents, contracts, regulations, and case law. Extracting structured information from these documents is a time-consuming and error-prone task. Docutron simplifies this process by using state-of-the-art computer vision and natural language processing techniques to automate the extraction of key information from legal documents.
